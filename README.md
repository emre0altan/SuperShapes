# SuperShapes
### SuperShapes made with Unity Job System

Supershapes are formula generated shapes based on sphere and ellipse. All meshes generated with same formula and different parameters. Below you can see the shapes that are formed by the change of only the time dependent parameter. With job system, runtime manipulation of 300k vertices gives around 45 fps which can be seen below with recording deduction. [Reference](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/supershape/)
